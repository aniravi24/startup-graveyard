# components/
Atomic jsx components that act as smarter HTML tags go here. Naming convention is
components/Component/Component.jsx. Each Component/ will have a Component.jsx file
and a corresponding Component.css file if necessary. The export.jsx file's sole
purpose is to import and export every Component.jsx file in the components/
directory. This will make using these components in other files much easier.
